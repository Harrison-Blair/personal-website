## Final Recommendation

### Keep Using Vercel ‚úÖ

**Reasons:**
1. **Already Configured**: The site is already on Vercel (per README)
2. **Perfect for Next.js**: Built by the Next.js team, zero configuration
3. **Industry Standard**: Best resume/portfolio value for modern React development
4. **Free Tier**: More than sufficient for personal portfolio
5. **GitHub Integration**: Automatic deployments, preview URLs
6. **Performance**: Best-in-class for Next.js with automatic optimizations

### If You Want AWS Experience

Consider **AWS Amplify** as a secondary deployment for learning purposes:
- Deploy the same site to both Vercel (production) and AWS Amplify (learning)
- Add AWS to your tech stack knowledge
- Keep Vercel as primary hosting due to superior Next.js optimization

### GitHub Actions Workflow Example (If Needed)

While Vercel has native GitHub integration, here's how you could set up a manual deployment workflow:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy-vercel.yml
name: Deploy to Vercel

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      - run: npm ci
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: amondnet/vercel-action@v25
        with:
          vercel-token: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
          vercel-org-id: ${{ secrets.ORG_ID}}
          vercel-project-id: ${{ secrets.PROJECT_ID}}
```
